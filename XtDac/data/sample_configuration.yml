# Energy min and max for the analysis, in eV
energy min: 500
energy max: 7000

# Number of cores to use for processing
number of processes: 8

# Probability of a Type I error in the Bayesian Block algorithm (the lower the value, the smaller the number of blocks)
type I error probability: 1e-5

# Threshold in significance for the likelihood analysis step after the Bayesian Blocks algorithm
sigma threshold: 4.0

# Multiplicity for the regions. A multiplicity of 2 means that there is half a size shift each region, 3 means there is
# a shift of 1/3 and so on
multiplicity: 3
