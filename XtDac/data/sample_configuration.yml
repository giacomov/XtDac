# Repository for the data. Fill it up with data using the "download_chandra_data.py" script.

data repository:

# Repository of the region files coming from the catalog. Fill it up with "xtc_download_region_files.py"

region repository:

# Repository for the output products. It must be already exist
output repository:

# Work directory. Before doing anything, xtdac_acis will move here. All the temporary files will be created in a sub
# directory of this working directory. Set it to '' to mean the directory where the script is launched. This is
# useful if you are running in a farm and you want to create the temporary file within the local hard drive on the
# node. You can use environment variables as $ENV_VARIABLE, like $HOME/work_dir or /scratch/$JOBID
# If the directory does not exist, it will be created
work directory:

# Remove work directory after the script has finished? yes or no. Note that if "work directory" is ".", then this will
# have no effect as xtdac_acis will refuse to remove the current directory. If this is 'no', all temporary directories
# will be kept, which is useful for debugging purposes
remove work directory: yes

# Energy min and max for the analysis, in eV
energy min: 500
energy max: 7000

# The code will increase the size of the ellipses defined in the Chandra Source Catalog
# by this factor, so 1.3 means increase by 30%, which means more events will be cut. This is to avoid
# triggering too much on variable sources
adjustment factor: 1.3

# Number of cores to use for processing
number of processes: 8

# Probability of a Type I error in the Bayesian Block algorithm (the lower the value, the smaller the number of blocks)
type I error probability: 1e-5

# Threshold in significance for the likelihood analysis step after the Bayesian Blocks algorithm
sigma threshold: 4.0

# Multiplicity for the regions. A multiplicity of 2 means that there is half-size shift between each region,
# 3 means there is a shift of 1/3 and so on, so the higher this number, the more regions will be searched. Note
# that this will increase the trial factor. Be careful that the number of regions increases quickly as the
# multiplicity increases. It doesn't probably make sense to go beyond 4
multiplicity: 3

# Verbosity of the output (either 'info' or 'debug')
verbosity: info
